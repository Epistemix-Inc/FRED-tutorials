# FRED Tutorials

The [FRED-tutorials repository](https://github.com/Epistemix-com/FRED-tutorials)
presents a collection of models that demonstrate the FRED language's
essential features. The intended audience for these tutorials is new users of
the FRED platform looking for practical examples of how the language features
described in this guide can be used to address real-world modeling problems.
Each model builds on the previous models by introducing new model components and
making use of additional language features. Consequently new users will probably
benefit from reading the tutorials in the following order:

1. [Simple Flu](simpleflu/README.md)
2. [Flu with Behavior](flu-with-behavior/README.md)
3. [Flu with School Closure](school-closure/README.md)
4. [Flu with Vaccine](vaccine/README.md)

We also hope experienced users will find the models described here, and the
programming patterns employed in their implementation, will serve as a useful
reference.

All the models discussed in these tutorials aim to represent a flu epidemic
spreading through a population, but each focuses on a different aspect of the
epidemiological and behavioral phenomena surrounding the epidemic. The Simple
Flu model is a foundational model of flu infection. The Flu with
Behavior and Flu with School Closure
models introduce social distancing and the effects of policies intended to
control the epidemic into the model. The Flu with Vaccine model
allows users to explore the use of a vaccine to influence the dynamics of the
epidemic.

The tutorials occasionally refer to additional documentation in the [FRED
Guide](https://epistemix-fred-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/). If you
don't have access to the guide, and would like to, please contact
