# FRED Tutorials

The [FRED-tutorials repository](https://github.com/Epistemix-com/FRED-tutorials)
presents a collection of models that demonstrate essential features of the FRED Modeling
Language™. The intended audience for these tutorials is new users of
the FRED Modeling Platform™ looking for practical examples of how the FRED language features
described in the [user guide](https://epistemix-fred-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)
can be used to address real-world modeling problems.
Each example builds on the previous examples by introducing new model components and
making use of additional language features. Consequently new users will
benefit from reading the tutorials in the following order:

1. [Simple Flu](simpleflu/README.md)
2. [Flu with Behavior](flu-with-behavior/README.md)
3. [Flu with School Closure](school-closure/README.md)
4. [Flu with Vaccine](vaccine/README.md)

We also hope experienced users find the models described here, and the
programming patterns employed in their implementation, a useful
reference.

The models discussed in these tutorials aim to represent a flu epidemic
spreading through a population, with each focusing on a different aspect of the
epidemiological and behavioral phenomena surrounding the epidemic. The Simple
Flu tutorial presents a foundational model of flu infection. The Flu with
Behavior and Flu with School Closure
tutorials introduce social distancing and the effects of policies intended to
control the epidemic into the model. The Flu with Vaccine tutorial
allows users to explore the use of a vaccine to influence the dynamics of the
epidemic.

The tutorials occasionally refer to additional documentation in the [FRED
Guide](https://docs.epistemix.com/projects/lang-guide/en/latest/).
